# 🏈 **Blood Bowl — Core Concepts & Rules**

## 1. Game Basics

- 2 players, each controls a fantasy football team.
- Played on a pitch of 15x26 squares.
- Goal: score touchdowns by getting the ball into the opponent’s end zone.
- Matches last **16 turns total** (8 per half, per team).

---

## 2. Turn Order (Player Turn)

You take **one full turn**, then opponent takes one turn, repeat.

### Your turn ends when

- You voluntarily finish it
- A turnover happens:
  - Player falls over
  - Failed pick-up
  - Failed pass/catch
  - Failed hand-off
  - Touchdown (resets next drive)

---

## 3. Player Actions

Each player model can take **1 Action per turn**:

| Action       | What it does                                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Move**     | Walk up to full MA (Movement Allowance)                   |
| **Block**    | Hit an adjacent opponent (no further moves unless Blitz)  |
| **Blitz**    | Move + 1 Block somewhere along the path                   |
| **Pass**     | Throw the ball to a target square/player                  |
| **Hand-Off** | Give ball to adjacent teammate (counts as pass action)    |
| **Foul**     | Kick a downed opponent (Risky, causes turnover if caught) |

---

## 4. Core Mechanics

### Blocks

- Roll **Block dice** (1–3 dice, depends on strength advantage)
- Results include:
  - **Attacker Down**, **Both Down**, **Push**, **Pow (Knockdown)**, **Defender Stumbles**

- Armor (AV) roll follows a knockdown to see if they get injured.

### Ball Play

- Pick-up, catch, pass, hand-off all use **AG (Agility)** rolls.
- Passing distance modifies roll: Quick, Short, Long, Bomb.

### Skills

Players start with permanent skills like:

- **Dodge**, **Block**, **Sure Hands**, **Pass**, etc.

Re-rolls:

- **Team Re-Rolls**: global, limited per half.
- **Skill Re-Rolls**: built-in, only for that action (e.g., Dodge skill re-rolls dodges).

---

## 5. Phases in a Drive

1. **Kick-off**
2. **Ball scatters**
3. You play 8 turns to try score/stop score.
4. Reset for next drive until half/game ends.

# 🏈 **Blood Bowl Sevens Rules**

## 1. Game Differences vs Standard

| Standard            | Sevens                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 11+ players         | **7 players**             |
| 8 turns per half    | **6 turns per half**      |
| 1,000,000 gold      | **600,000 gold**          |
| Big pitch           | **Reduced pitch (11x17)** |
| Normal skill access | **More random level ups** |
| Kick-off table used | **Simpler kick rules**    |

---

## 2. 7s Turn Order & Actions

- Turn order is the same: 1 team turn each, alternating.
- Actions per player are the same:
  - Move, Block, Blitz, Pass, Hand-off, Foul

- **Turnovers** also work the same.

---

# 🧪 Building a 7s Team

## 1. Team creation rules

- **600k gold**
- **11 players max** on roster
- Must field **exactly 7**
- Team re-rolls and staff are cheaper at creation **BUT grow in cost later** like standard.

## 2. Typical optimal 7s build

- 7 core players
- 2–3 bench linemen (cheap)
- 1–2 re-rolls (you can’t afford 3 usually)
- Apothecary is optional, often skipped early leagues due to low gold.

---

# ⭐ Leveling in 7s

## 1. Earning SPP is the same

- TD 3 | CAS 2 | Completion 1 | MVP 4

## 2. Level ups are more random

- Cannot choose skills freely like Standard.
- Usually roll **random primary skills** unless league allows house options.

## 3. Post-game sequence is the same

1. Injuries
2. MVP
3. SPP
4. Level up
5. Winnings (usually smaller d6)
6. Update TV & buy stuff

---

# 🏆 7s League Play

## 1. League roster cap & escalation

- Rosters smaller, games faster.
- TV escalates slower.
- Underdog inducements exist but budget is tiny so star players are rare.

## 2. Meta differences

- More passing plays (due to open pitch)
- Positionals matter more (each player is ~14% of roster)
- Fouls are stronger (less players means removals hit harder)
